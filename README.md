# hello-world

Hello, world.

I am Seji OH, a data scientist in South Korea.
I love exploring knowledge in various fields and reading a lot of books.

This GitHub repositories will be places for my personal projects
to improve my skills and search for a job or further (hopefully).

I feel like I fall in love - one way love with a job searching itself.

I do not know when I could achieve the love or even be recognized from it, any company.

Hello?

Are you there?

I am here.

And I am wating.
